# Xiaolong - Week of 02/24/2020

## 1. Papers and code

### 1.1 Papers Read

[PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/): The challenge is a benchmark in visual object detection, it provide a standard dataset of images and annotation, which has been used in Faster RCNN and YOLO. 



### 1.2 Code Written

[read_xml.ipynb](source/read_xml.ipynb): In this notebook, I write a script to read xml file and draw a bound box on the image. 



## 2. Figures

Figure 1. An example of labeled images. The bound box information inside folder annotations. 

## 3. Results

To achieve the automatic detection of light echoes, the first thing needed is to build a image dataset with high quality annotation. I label some image in the format of PASCAL VOC. Next I will try to use these image to train a model and test the performance of different models.
