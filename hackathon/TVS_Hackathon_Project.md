# TVS Hackathon Project: 

## 1. Question:  
How do we prepare LSST to discover the unknown?

To evaluate LSST's ability by cadence's  filters, fiveSigmaDepth, and so on.




## 2. Deliverable:  

-  metrics  that can run on opsim databases.

-  jupyter notebooks that explains how to run, and how to inteperate the results

- figure of merit 

- results from  opsim databases

  

## 3. Scope:  

##### Day 1:

Install docker and maf, download opsim databases, 

explore information inside, and learn to run maf on opsim databases

explore available metrics, and perpare to write new ones

##### Day 2: 

design new metric, 

coding and testing, run on opsim 

write jupyter notebook tutorials for the new metric

##### Day 3: 

run the metric for different cadences

plot skymap and other feature maps

present the results


## 4. Data and Software: 
#### Software

Docker [https://docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/)
MAF [https://sims-maf.lsst.io](https://sims-maf.lsst.io/)

Pull Image [https://hub.docker.com/r/oboberg/maf](https://hub.docker.com/r/oboberg/maf)

#### Data

opsim databases http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:8081/

latest https://lsst-web.ncsa.illinois.edu/sim-data/sims_featureScheduler_runs_1.3/baseline/

## 5. Skills:

have some experience with python,

familiar numpy, pandas, matplotlib

familiar with MAF is a plus




## 6. Pitch:

LSST has ability to obtain unknown

Colors important

how evolves, 

relation between different color,
