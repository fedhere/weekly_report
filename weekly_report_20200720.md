### 1.1 Papers Read

[X-ray study of spatial structures in Tycho's supernova remnant using unsupervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09210): This paper apply variational autoencoder (VAE) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to study the X-ray observations of Tycho's supernova remnant. The dimensions of the observed data are reduced by the VAE and clustering in feature space is done by GMM.  They showed that unsupervised machine learning can be useful for extracting characteristic spatial structures from spectral information in observational data.
